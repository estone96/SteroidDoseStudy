# Introduction
Glucocorticoids are a class of corticosteroids, which are a class of steroid hormones. Glucocorticoids are corticosteroids that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor that is present in almost every vertebrate animal cell. The name "glucocorticoid" is a portmanteau (glucose + cortex + steroid) and is composed from its role in regulation of glucose metabolism, synthesis in the adrenal cortex, and its steroidal structure (see structure to the right).

Glucocorticoids are part of the feedback mechanism in the immune system, which reduces certain aspects of immune function, such as inflammation. They are therefore used in medicine to treat diseases caused by an overactive immune system, such as allergies, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and sepsis. Glucocorticoids have many diverse (pleiotropic) effects, including potentially harmful side effects, and as a result are rarely sold over the counter. They also interfere with some of the abnormal mechanisms in cancer cells, so they are used in high doses to treat cancer. This includes inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation, as in the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias, and the mitigation of side effects of anticancer drugs.

Glucocorticoids affect cells by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. The activated glucocorticoid receptor-glucocorticoid complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of proinflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression).

Glucocorticoids are distinguished from mineralocorticoids and sex steroids by their specific receptors, target cells, and effects. In technical terms, "corticosteroid" refers to both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (as both are mimics of hormones produced by the adrenal cortex), but is often used as a synonym for "glucocorticoid". Glucocorticoids are chiefly produced in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, whereas mineralocorticoids are synthesized in the zona glomerulosa.

Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. Various synthetic glucocorticoids are available; these are widely utilized in general medical practice and numerous specialties either as replacement therapy in glucocorticoid deficiency or to suppress the immune system.

Side effects

Immunodeficiency (see section below)
Hyperglycemia due to increased gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, and impaired glucose tolerance ("steroid diabetes"); caution in those with diabetes mellitus
Increased skin fragility, easy bruising
Negative calcium balance due to reduced intestinal calcium absorption[42]
Steroid-induced osteoporosis: reduced bone density (osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, higher fracture risk, slower fracture repair)
Weight gain due to increased visceral and truncal fat deposition (central obesity) and appetite stimulation; see corticosteroid-induced lipodystrophy
Hypercortisolemia with prolonged or excessive use (also known as, exogenous Cushing's syndrome)
Impaired memory and attention deficits[43]
Adrenal insufficiency (if used for long time and stopped suddenly without a taper)
Muscle and tendon breakdown (proteolysis), weakness, reduced muscle mass and repair[44][25]
Expansion of malar fat pads and dilation of small blood vessels in skin
Lipomatosis within the epidural space[45]
Excitatory effect on central nervous system (euphoria, psychosis)
Anovulation, irregularity of menstrual periods
Growth failure, delayed puberty
Increased plasma amino acids, increased urea formation, negative nitrogen balance
Glaucoma due to increased ocular pressure
Cataracts
Topical steroid addiction

#How to run
==========
1. In `R`, use the following code to install the dependencies:

```{r}
install.packages('data.table')
install.packages('doSNOW')
install.packages('ROCR')
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages("remotes")
install.packages("DatabaseConnector")
install.packages('CohortMethod')
install.packages('survey')
install.packages('caret')
```

2. Load all the libraries
```{r}
require('data.table')
require('doSNOW')
require('ROCR')
require('dplyr')
require("remotes")
require("DatabaseConnector")
require('CohortMethod')
require('survey')
require('caret')
```

3. Add below details of your CDM database in "CodeToRun.R"

```{r}
cdmDatabaseSchema <- "" ## server_database.server_scheme 
resultsDatabaseSchema <- ""

connectionDetails <- DatabaseConnector::createConnectionDetails(dbms = "", #"postgresql"
                                                                server = "",
                                                                user = "",
                                                                password = "",
                                                                port = NULL)
```

When error caused by missing JDBC drivers, download required JDBC drivers using:
```{r}
Sys.setenv("DATABASECONNECTOR_JAR_FOLDER" = "C:/JDBC") 
downloadJdbcDrivers() #postgresql, redshift .. etc
```

4. Congratulations. All done 


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
